# About TikTok App Events SDK
The TikTok App Events SDK enables you to transmit app events, such as Installs, Add to Cart, or Purchases, directly from your mobile app to TikTok. After events are shared, you can view event data in TikTok Events Manager, create audiences for targeting, and optimize your campaigns based on the app events.

For developer details including integration instructions, see [TikTok App Events SDK documentation](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal/docs?id=1739584951798785).
